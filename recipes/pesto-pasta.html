        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pesto Pasta with chicken breast and broccoli! Super easy and healthy - this is 
            what I survived off when I was studying abroad in the summer of 2024.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta (I like Barilla Fusilli)</li>
            <li>Jarred Pesto Sauce</li>
            <li>Chicken Breast</li>
            <li>Broccoli</li>
            <li>Fresh Parsley (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Cheese (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start boiling two pots of water.</li>
            <li>Cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces and then pan fry
                them in some neutral oil. Season with salt and pepper. When cooked through, set aside. </li>
            <li>Start cooking your pasta to al dente.</li>
            <li>Cut up your broccoli and boil for 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once that is all done, start sauteing some garlic in a large pan.</li>
            <li>Throw your pasta in there and then throw the chicken and brocolli in. Put in some jarred pesto sauce.</li>
            <li>Saute for a few more minutes and you're done! Garnish with optional parsley and cheese.</li>
        </ol>
